# AQGB1200

Plan on documenting details of the AQGB1200 here.

The AQGB1200 "[Aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics) GrowBed 1200 Litres" has 2 identical growbeds on either end and an opening in the middle to view / interact with the fish.

The unit is one piece moldeld poly and has no holes in the grow beds so you will need to drill them to suit your own needs.




## Phyiscal Specs

 Type | Main Unit (External) | Growbed (Internal)
-----|------|-----
Length | 236cm | 82cm
Width | 76cm | 66cm
Height / Depth | 84cm | 24cm

## Plumbing
1 water pump in center of tank feeding both growbeds with a "T" fitting and a flow valve for each bed ( helps control flow if there are isseus starting or stopping siphon ). Each growbed has its own bell siphon using gravity to return water back to the tank.


Each bell siphon was made with the following parts.
- Outer cover ( Bell ):
  - 1x 90mm PVC, 30cm long*
  - 2x 90mm push on end cap

*The outer bell length is cut long enough to access for maintenance or pulling standpipe to shorten / adjust water level height without draining bed of media.


- Stand Pipe:
  - 1x 20mm PVC , 18cm long*
  - 1x 25mm to 20mm reducer
  - 1x 20mm PVC pressure pipe

*This determines the max water height in growbed before siphon begins returning water to the tank below. 

- Return Pipe:
  - More coming soon! :)
