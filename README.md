Documenting an aquaponic system build using a AQGB1200.

The AQGB1200 ([Aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics) GrowBed 1200 Litres) has 2 identical growbeds on either end and an opening in the middle to view / interact with the fish.

The unit is one piece moldeld poly, holes need to be drilled to suit your application (growbed bell sihpons / tank overflow etc).



## Phyiscal Specs

 Type | Main Unit (External) | Growbed  (Internal)
-----|------|-----
Length | 236cm | 82cm
Width | 76cm | 66cm
Height / Depth | 84cm | 24cm

## Plumbing
1 water pump in center of tank with a "T" fitting, growbeds each have their own flow valve ( helps control flow if there are issues starting or stopping siphon ). Each growbed has its own bell siphon using gravity to return water back to the tank. No fittings are glued. I only screw ( through growbeds ) or push on fittings by hand

Each grow bed has a bell siphon with the following parts:

- Stand Pipe:
  - 1x 25mm to 20mm reducer (A)
  - 1x 20mm PVC, 18cm long* (B)
  - 1x 20mm threaded coupling (C)
  
*This determines the max water height in growbed before siphon begins returning water to the tank below. 

- Bell ( Outer Cover ):
  - 2x 90mm push on end cap (D, F)
  - 1x 90mm PVC, 30cm long* (E)

*The outer bell length is cut long enough to access for maintenance or pulling stand pipe out to shorten / adjust water level height without removing bed of media.

- Return Pipe:
  - 1x 20mm threaded coupling (G)
  - 1x 20mm 90 degree elbow (H)
  - 1x 20mm PVC, 15cm long* (used instead of I)
  
*This creates some back pressure and helps start the siphon. Personal preference if you need / want to use an extra 90 elbow.


## Fish Feeder
A custom built fish feeder using a raspberry pi, 12V garage door motor with an auger drill bit and some PVC pipes / fittings.
